### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A post by me: [Complexity Fills the Space it's Given](https://medium.com/@wilsontomass/complexity-fills-the-space-its-given-762fabc401c8)

I started putting some links into my enterprise github of blogposts I particularly like, so at the risk of being excessively cringe I will start doing so here as well.

[do-not-be-the-smartest-in-the-room-try-to-be-the-kindest](https://www.jorgegalindo.me/en/blog/posts/do-not-be-the-smartest-in-the-room-try-to-be-the-kindest)

[if-you-dont-understand-a-problem-you-re-not-allowed-to-fix-it](https://therealgriff.medium.com/if-you-dont-understand-a-problem-you-re-not-allowed-to-fix-it-af6b8054606c)

[Advice](https://dynomight.substack.com/p/advice), [Things to be thankful for](https://dynomight.net/thanks/) and basically anything written by [DYNOMIGHT](https://dynomight.net)

Everything not massively outdated in [The Mythical Man Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)

Lots of the work by [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) but of course [The Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)

At this point if you haven't already realised this is mostly just posts you regularly find on [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com)
