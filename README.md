### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Some posts by me:  
[If I Could Wave a Magic Wand](https://wilsoniumite.com/2024/12/30/if-i-could-wave-a-magic-wand/)  
[Are LLMs Any Good at Ranking People](https://wilsoniumite.com/2024/10/18/are-llms-any-good-at-ranking-people/)  
[Weâ€™ve lost our respect for complexity](https://wilsoniumite.com/2025/01/21/weve-lost-our-respect-for-complexity/)  

I started putting some links into my enterprise github of posts I particularly like, so at the risk of being excessively cringe I will start doing so here as well.

Everything not massively outdated in [The Mythical Man Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)

Lots of the work by [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) but of course [The Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)
